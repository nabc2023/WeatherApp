# Weather App

This is a simple weather app that uses the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch weather data for a given location and displays it on the screen.

## Usage

To use this app, you'll need to get an API key from OpenWeatherMap. Once you have your API key, simply replace "YOUR_API_KEY" in the code with your actual API key.

Then, run the script and enter a city name when prompted. The app will fetch the weather data for that city and display it on the screen.
